                            Low space requirements, good heat dissipation and short conductive paths are only some of the
                            reasons why the semiconductor industry relies on solder balls, so-called „bumps“, of all kinds for
                            contacting different chip levels and entire components with one circuit board. Ball grid arrays use a
                            vertical path for electrical contact, leading to high demands on the coplanarity of the applied solder
                            beads and the entire component.
                        </p>

                    <p class="fw-medium mt-3">
                        Bump height, warpage and coplanarity monitoring is therefore
                        indispensable to ensure the reliability of the subsequent soldering step. This applies to printed
                        bumps as well as electrochemically applied copper pillars, which contain a copper cylinder in
                        addition to the solder hemisphere to bridge a height difference.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-medium">
                        Constant miniaturization, the most important pacemaker in the further development of
    semiconductor components, also affects the connections, which is why bumps and copper pillars
    cover every height range - from a height of a few micrometers to solder balls with a diameter of a
    millimeter. Interconnects with a diameter of 20 micrometers or less place increasingly higher
    demands on the measurement technology used. Solarius’s chromatic, confocal and
    triangulating sensors cover all size ranges of the contacts and enable reliable 100% high volume
    process control.

                            The height, diameter and thus the volume of the bump determine the amount of solder that is
                            available for establishing the connection between the integrated circuit and the printed circuit board.
                            To check the quantity of solder, it is therefore necessary to measure the height of bloom in relation
                            to the environment and the diameter. 
                        </p>

                    <p class="fw-medium mt-3">
                        In addition to errors in height and diameter, the complete
                        absence of the bump can also occur, as can the fusion of two solder balls into so-called bridges, or
                        incorrect positioning. For a safe function of the products, such defects must be found and the faulty
                        circuits must be sorted out automatically. Solarius technology also allows the measurement of
                        diffcult-to-capture shapes over a wide size and dynamic range, making it ideally suited for measuring
                        bumps.

                    <p class="fw-medium">
                        Not only the height of individual bumps is important, but also their heights in combination. A
    component equipped with bumps always lies on three points, which define the so-called „seating
    plane“. The height deviation of all other solder points from the seating plane is understood as
    „seating plane coplanarity“. If this value is too high, it can no longer be guaranteed that a suffcient
    electrical contact is established after reflow soldering, which is why coplanarity monitoring is an
    essential component in the process chain. Besides the seating plane, other reference planes are also
    useful, such as the global plane, which is determined as a least-square plane by all bumps. Those
    values can all be obtained within one “shot” via Solarius technology.

                            The coplanarity values are the result of the individual bump heights combined with the flatness of
        the substrate. This flatness is determined at the same time as the measurement of the bump heights
        and provides information on the previous production processes.

                        When the production of an integrated circuit in the frontend is completed with the sawing of the
    wafer, its packaging begins in the backend. This means the attachment of the chip to a carrier or on a
    heat sink, the electrical contacting and embedding in an insulating resin as well as possibly the
    installation in a housing. Bonding the sawn dies to a carrier plate with subsequent embedding in an
    epoxy resin is a cost-effective way of converting a processed silicon dies into a robust devic

                            Electrical contacting is often realized using wire bonds, which allow manufacturers the greatest
        possible flexibility: depending on requirements, one can choose between different expensive wire
        materials. The wire diameter and shape can be individually adapted for each component with a high
        degree of variability to provide most robust packages for rough and security relevant environments.

                        High reflectivity, small dimensions and steep slopes make detection and measurement of bonding
    wires diffcult. High quantities and short cycle times intensify these difficulties. However, Solarius‘
    broad portfolio has an answer to every of these challenges, allowing to capture even the most
    complex geometries accurately, reproducibly and automatically.

                            To ensure a reliable bonding process, the die must be connected to the base plate in the correct
        position, including height, angle, rotation and warpage. With countless process steps in the minimum
        of time, however, misalignments occur frequently. In addition, the adherence to the bonding wire
        height provides a statement about the reliability of the bonding process. If the bonding wire height is
        not correct, the cause lies in torn wires or an incorrect travel path of the capillary. Thin, round and
        specular refl ective wires are diffcult test targets for most optical inspection systems. With Solarius

                        During the extremely fast bonding process, mispositioning may occur, making the whole device
    unfunctional. Automatic detection of balls, stitches and wedges allows you to dispense with manual,
    labor-intensive control without the risk of customer complaints. The wire metal used is transferred
    into the melt via a combination of heat, pressure and possibly ultrasound and contacted with the
    pad of the chip. A characteristic „ball“ is formed, whose shape and size allow conclusions to be
    drawn about the quality of the contact with the pad.

                        Beyond establishing the connection, the epoxy resin is purposed to fill existing cavities and to seal
                        the device. The exact adherence to the quantity of epoxy resin is a prerequisite for the perfect
                        functioning of the components: excess epoxy can lead to non-compliance with the component
                        geometry, too little is the cause for an improper connection. With Solarius technology, this process
                        can be monitored in the line and a reliable inspection of the components can be carried out.
