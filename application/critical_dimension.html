                <p class="fw-medium">For the measurement of structures in the sub-micrometer range, few relevant
                    alternatives to scanning probe or electron microscopy have been offered so far. Both methods are
                    time and labor intensive and require trained operators to set up the measurements. Disadvantages of
                    these
                    measurement techniques are that surface features can be distorted by shear forces in contact mode,
                    the measuring needle reacts unbalanced or, that measurements are not possible non-destructively.

                <p class="fw-medium">White light interferometry allows the acquisition of 3D information with height
                    resolutions even
                    below one nanometer. However, the lateral resolution of interferometers is not sufficient for the
                    measurement of structures below one micrometer and is limited to 0.20 to 0.40 Î¼m because white
                    light is used. Unlike triangulation methods, the measurement accuracy of white light interferometry
                    does not depend on the distance of the measured object, which makes this measurement method
                    suitable for a wide variety of objects and surfaces, such as deep holes or transparent surfaces.
                    However, difficulties can arise when measuring close to production, as the method is very sensitive
                    to vibrations.</p>

                <p class="fw-medium">
                    Another option for obtaining 3D information is 3D confocal microscopy. In addition to obtaining
                    high-
                    precision height information, confocal masking of defocused points allows lateral resolutions below
                    those of ordinary reflected or transmitted light microscopes. Like any measurement technique, the
                    confocal technique is also not free of artifacts. However, for rough and finely textured surfaces,
                    it
                    proves to be more robust than other techniques, and compared to atomic force microscopy (AFM),
                    large areas can be covered at high speed. However, confocal 3D microscopy, based on previously
                    known methods, fails to separate individual surfaces from each other when measuring the thinnest
                    transparent layers in the range of one micrometer and below.

                    Obligatory for the measurement with highest resolutions is the diffraction limited construction of
                    microscopes and the use of high numerical aperture objectives. While this still can easily be
                    realized
                    with relatively slower laser scanning systems, rotating disks used as pinhole in spinning-disc
                    confocal
                    microscopes leads to imaging errors, i.e. deviations from the optimal imaging by the optical system,
                    which make it impossible to measure microgeometries. The role of imaging errors should not be
                    underestimated, only with very high quality optics the influence of these errors is physically
                    small.
                    With the use of pinhole apertures, fast scanning is guaranteed, but often a large part of the
                    illumination is lost at the disk. If the samples to be examined then also contain transparent layers
                    whose thicknesses lie in the range of the half-width of the confocal signal, obtaining reliable
                    height
                    information seems impossible.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-medium">In the present study by Solarius, an inspection of so-called copper pillars was
                    performed. These microscopic copper pillars consist of a cylinder of copper and a small cap of
                    solder and are used in chip manufacturing. They form recesses of a few tens of nanometers embedded
                    in a transparent matrix with diameters and spacings well below one micrometer. In terms of lateral
                    dimension, they are thus at the absolute limit of microscopy.
                <p class="fw-medium">
                    The image data is acquired in a familiar manner. The height measurement range to be examined is
                    stepped through and a confocal microscope image is acquired for each step. The measuring field is
                    relatively large at over 7,500 Î¼mÂ², so that more than 3,000 of the structures to be examined can be
                    recorded simultaneously. A complex evaluation of the confocal curves is used to assign one or - in
                    layer systems - several height values to each X-Y coordinate. This is where Solarius comes in.
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src="../images/Application/5.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p class="fw-medium">A confocal curve not only contains height and reflection information of an image
                    point, but also
                    extensive information about the imaging errors of the measuring system used. These can be
                    mathematically determined by means of an algorithm and then excluded from the calculation of the
                    surface topography. In this way, objects with even the smallest structures can be detected and
                    measured with high repeatability. The depth vias could be accurately calculated with a repeatability
                    of only 3.7 nm. The determination of the diameters resulted in a repeatability of just 7 nm, which
                    corresponds to less than 1 % of the measured size.</p>
                <p class="fw-medium">
                    Via this novel evaluation of the determined confocal data, Solarius is able to create realistic 3D
                    images of surfaces even for micro-geometries and the thinnest transparent layers. The 3D
                    measurement method presented here thus enters an unrivaled niche and far surpasses conventional
                    scanning examination methods in terms of measurement speed, area acquisition rate and quality of
                    the optical measurement data.

                    The high quality of the sensor raw data in combination with sophisticated signal processing and
                    intelligent image processing algorithms allows to advance the transitional area of confocal
                    metrology
                    towards the AFM systems domain. In line monitoring of self aligment structures are a good proof to
                    show the Solarius technology lead in confocal 3D imaging. In the image to the right, self aligment
                    structures with a line frequency of 2Î¼m and spacer depth of 3Î¼m are shown. Such live structures can
                    be measured with precision and accuracy values below 1% of the structure size using Solarius
                    Confocal microscopy tools. The process supports line and space structure asessement throughout
                    the diffrent pocess steps. Dimensions can be assessed reliably after lithography in the developed
